                    "Iâ€™m Seth Korantwi, a creative and motivated learner with a keen interest in web development and technology. As an international student at NSCC, Iâ€™m committed to mastering the art of coding, designing, and bringing innovative ideas to life. My journey into tech has been fueled by curiosity, persistence, and a love for crafting solutions that make life easier and more engaging. <br> <br>
                    Outside the classroom, youâ€™ll often find me on the soccer field or basketball court, enjoying the thrill of the game and staying active. I also cherish quiet moments of self-improvement, whether itâ€™s picking up a new skill, diving into a good book, or experimenting with creative projects. My ultimate goal is to grow into a skilled developer who can blend creativity with functionality, shaping the digital experiences of tomorrow. Iâ€™m excited about the future and grateful to share my journey with you through this platform."
